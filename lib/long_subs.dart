/*Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring
 without repeating characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.*/

int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    var input = s;
    Set<String> letters = {};
    int maxSubString = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {

      while (letters.contains(input[i])) {
        letters.remove(letters.first);
      }
      letters.add(input[i]);
      if (letters.length > maxSubString) {
        maxSubString = letters.length;
